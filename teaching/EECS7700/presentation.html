                            This paper introduces a novel sequence transduction model architecture named the Transformer. 
                            This architecture is based solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recursion and convolution. 
                            The model addresses the limitations of sequence models that rely on recursive processes, which perform poorly in parallelization and computational efficiency for longer sequences.
                            The Transformer adopts an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder consists of identical layers with multi-head self-attention and fully connected feed-forward networks, 
                            while the decoder mirrors this structure but adds a multi-head attention layer on the encoder's output; utilizing scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention, 
                            the model computes the importance of key-value pairs based on queries and allows joint attention across different subspaces, 
                            with encoder-decoder attention enabling the decoder to focus on all input positions, 
                            self-attention improving contextual understanding by attending to all positions within layers, 
                            and positional encodings ensuring the model captures the order of tokens in a sequence.

                            <b>Blog Post 1: ResNet </b> <br>
                            As the number of layers of neural networks increases, the problems of overfitting, gradient vanishing, and gradient explosion often occur, so this article came into being. In this paper, the concept of deep residual networks (ResNets) is proposed. By introducing "shortcut connections," this study solves the problem of gradient vanishing in deep network training and has an important impact on the field of deep learning. The method of the paper explicitly redefines the network layers as learning residual functions relative to the inputs. By learning residuals, the network can be optimized more easily and can train deeper models more efficiently. Therefore, this method can help solve the performance degradation problem that may occur when the network layer increases. In addition, the article displays the experimental part. The model shows significant improvements in handling large-scale visual recognition tasks like ImageNet and CIFAR-10. The application of deep residual networks in major visual recognition competitions like ILSVRC and COCO 2015 further proves their power and wide applicability.
