                            The paper introduces Faster R-CNN, a deep learning-based object detection framework that improves upon previous region-based detection models by integrating a Region Proposal Network (RPN). Unlike earlier methods that relied on computationally expensive region proposal algorithms, Faster R-CNN shares convolutional features between region proposal and object detection networks, making the process nearly cost-free. The RPN generates region proposals efficiently, which are then refined by the Fast R-CNN detector. The experimental results demonstrate that Faster R-CNN significantly improves detection accuracy while achieving real-time processing speeds, making it a powerful tool for object detection tasks.

                            As the number of layers of neural networks increases, the problems of overfitting, gradient vanishing, and gradient explosion often occur, so this article came into being. In this paper, the concept of deep residual networks (ResNets) is proposed. By introducing "shortcut connections," this study solves the problem of gradient vanishing in deep network training and has an important impact on the field of deep learning. The method of the paper explicitly redefines the network layers as learning residual functions relative to the inputs. By learning residuals, the network can be optimized more easily and can train deeper models more efficiently. Therefore, this method can help solve the performance degradation problem that may occur when the network layer increases. In addition, the article displays the experimental part. The model shows significant improvements in handling large-scale visual recognition tasks like ImageNet and CIFAR-10. The application of deep residual networks in major visual recognition competitions like ILSVRC and COCO 2015 further proves their power and wide applicability.
