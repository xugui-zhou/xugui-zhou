            <p> <b>Instructor:</b> Xugui Zhou, xuguizhou@lsu.edu, Office: PFT 3330H </br>
                <b>Office Hour:</b> TBD 
            </p>

            <p> <b>Time:</b> Tu/Th 10:30-11:45 am <br>
                <b>Location:</b> Patrick F. Taylor Hall 1216
            </p>
        </br>
            <p> This graduate-level course explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the design and development of autonomous driving systems. Students will gain a deep understanding of how AI-driven technologies enable autonomous vehicles to perceive, reason, and act in complex, dynamic environments. The course covers essential topics such as machine learning, computer vision, sensor fusion, decision-making, path planning, and real-time control for autonomous driving.
            </p>

            <p> Through a combination of theoretical lectures, research paper discussions, and hands-on projects, students will explore the key algorithms and architectures that power modern autonomous vehicles. The course also addresses safety, ethical, and regulatory challenges, along with industry trends in autonomous driving technology.
            </p>    
            <p> By the end of the course, students will be equipped to design, implement, and evaluate AI-driven solutions for autonomous vehicles. This course prepares students for advanced research or careers in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and related industries.
            </p>
